<h1 style= "color: #8ca1ad; font-family: Garamond, Times New Roman, Serif; text-align:center;">Sechzehnter Januar</h1>

<p style="color: #657b87;font-family: Garamond, Times New Roman, Serif;  text-align:center;">January sixteenth. <br/>Last week
was like a breakdown. <br/>Impossible
to sleep, <br/>impossible to wake up<br/>
impossible to endure life, <br/>more
precisely,<br/> the succession of life. </p>

<p style="color: #4a616e;font-family: Garamond, Times New Roman, Serif; text-align:center;">The clocks don’t agree. <br/>What’s inside races in a devilish
or demonic, <br/>or at least inhuman
way. <br/>The outside world stumbles on, <br/>takes
its usual course. <br/>What else
can happen except that the two
worlds separate, <br/>and so they do<br/>
or tear apart at least in some dreadful
way. </p>

<p style="color: #344d5a;font-family: Garamond, Times New Roman, Serif; text-align:center;">That loneliness,<br/>
for the most part forced
upon me, <br/>was partly sought<br/>
(though what was it other than force?)<br/>
and becomes now unequivocal, <br/>goes
on to the very end.  <br/>It can
only lead,<br/> it seems, <br/> to insanity.<br/>
Nothing more to be said about it.</p>

<p style="color: #233e4d;font-family: Garamond, Times New Roman, Serif; text-align:center;">The hunt goes through me and tears me apart.<br/>
or – maybe just this once – <br/>I can
keep going, <br/> let myself be carried away
by the hunt. <br/>Where do I go then? <br/>Hunting is only
an image – <br/>you could also say:<br/> hurling myself
against the final, <br/>earthly frontier.</p>
